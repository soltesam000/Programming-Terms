# Programming-Terms
### Programming is a designing of robot motions without physical human interaction. Its making various sets of instructions for the robot to follow on the computer. Loops themselves contain conditional statements in order to tell them when to run and how long to continue. The simple Do loop can be used to enclose your whole program, when it reaches the end of the code it returns to the beginning and starts again. Its an expected repeated behavior that the robot is programmed to do. A function is a group of statements that are run as a single unit when the function is called from another location. Functions offer a number of distinct advantages over basic step-by-step coding. The conditional states enable the computer to do diferent commands depending on the different conditions.
